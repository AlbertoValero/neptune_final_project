# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

## Abstract

The main goal of this project is to apply the basic contents explored during this MAMED course held at Villefranche-sur-Mer. For doing so, I will first used the regular expressions search and replace methods. Further, I will benefit of markdown to format my text file and include images and references.

This project used protein sequences and, if times permit, I would like to explore the different ways of visualization of the opsin phylogeny that we constructed for helping the reader to have a better interation with our published opsin phylogeny in an iteractive way. 

More in concrete, I will first rename the name of the sequences that I will use. These data are contained in {DAniello:2015gm}.
