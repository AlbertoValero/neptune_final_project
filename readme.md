# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Diel-Vertical migration of marine zooplankton

## Abstract

The main goal of this project is to apply the contents explored during this MAMED course held at Villefranche-sur-Mer. 

More in concrete, I will try to adapt some scripts previously develop in MatLab for controling a custom-built set-up. This machine is being created in collaboration with Dan-Eric Nilsson (Vision Group, Lund University), and allows to analize the density of the population of marine invertebrate larvae in a 400X10X10mm water column during time under different light conditions. 

Once I am able to convert my data into a .tsv file I wll create a Multi-Series Line Chart extracted from bl.ocks.org. Further, I will benefit of markdown to format my text file and include images and references.

## 'What is diel-vertical migration'

Every day, zooplankton make their way to deep water and rise. This process, known as diel vertical migration, is carried out all over the world by marine and freshwater plankton alike. The reason for this has long been attributed to the trade-off between obtaining tasty morsels in the surface ocean and avoiding becoming a tasty morsel for predators while they're there.
