# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Diel-Vertical migration of marine zooplankton

## Abstract

The main goal of this project is to apply the contents explored during this MAMED course held at Villefranche-sur-Mer. 

More in concrete, I will try to adapt some scripts previously develop in D3js.org for tracing the diel-vertical migration of marine zooplaktonic larvae in a custom-built set-up. This set-up is being created in collaboration with Dan-Eric Nilsson (Vision Group, Lund University), and allows to analize the density of the population of marine invertebrate larvae in a 400X10X10mm water column during time under different light conditions. 

Once I am able to convert my data into a .tsv file I will create a Multi-Series Line Chart extracted from bl.ocks.org. Further, I will benefit of markdown to format my text file and include images and references.

## Photoreception classes

While the vast majority of studies had been focus on directional photoreceptors – systems comprising at least one cell with a photosensitive opsin and shading pigments that enable it to discriminate light directionality – less is known about non-directional photoreception, which is considered the earliest evolving type of photoreception. 

Non-directional photoreceptors, which can be difficult to detect without molecular tools, allow to monitor the ambient light intensity. They are widely used as an input to the circadian clock system and also for a wide variety of other tasks. For instance, non-directional photoreceptors can be used for detecting shadows or harmful levels of UV radiation or be involved in the regulation of feeding, movement and reproduction rhythms (Bennett, 1979; Paul and Gwynn-Jones, 2003; Leech et al., 2005; Nilsson, 2009; 2013).

In my work I try to better-understand the non-directional photoreceptors of the echinopluteus larvae of the sea urchin *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*.

## 'What is diel-vertical migration'

Every day, zooplankton make their way to deep water and rise. This process, known as diel vertical migration, is carried out all over the world by marine and freshwater plankton alike. The reason for this has long been attributed to the trade-off between obtaining tasty morsels in the surface ocean and avoiding becoming a tasty morsel for predators while they're there.
